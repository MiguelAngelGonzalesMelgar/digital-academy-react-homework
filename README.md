# React Assignment N 9

## Exercise 1

- Build a component that lets users manage a list of colors and change the page background.

- Users can add a color by typing a hex code (like #ff0000) into an input and pressing Add.

- The list of colors is displayed as small color swatches.
  Clicking a color swatch changes the entire page background to that color.

## Exercise 2

- Build a component that tracks and displays the current window width and height.

- On component mount, read current window size and display it.
  Add a resize event listener to update width and height in state whenever the window resizes.

- Clean up the event listener on unmount.
  Hints:
  Use window.innerWidth and window.innerHeight to get dimensions.
